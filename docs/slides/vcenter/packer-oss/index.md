This slide presentation is stored as Markdown code, specifically using the RemarkJS engine to render it. All standard markdown tags are supported, and you can also use some HTML within this document.

If you need to change the look and feel of the slide deck just use the style.css and remark_settings.js files to suit your needs. The content in this file is picked up by index.html when the page is loaded.

HTML comments like this one will show up in the source code, but not in the slides or speaker notes.

# Introductions
- Your Name
- Job Title
- Automation Experience
- Favorite Text Editor

???
Use this slide to introduce yourself, give a little bit of your background story, then go around the room and have all your participants introduce themselves.

The favorite text editor question is a good ice breaker, but perhaps more importantly it gives you an immediate gauge of how technical your users are.

**There are no wrong answers to this question. Unless you say Notepad. Friends don't let friends write code in Notepad.**

**If you don't have a favorite text editor, that's okay! Our cloud lab has Visual Studio Code preinstalled. VSC is a free programmer's text editor for Microsoft, and it has great Packer support. Most of this workshop will be simply copying and pasting code, so if you're not a developer don't fret. Packer is easy to learn and fun to work with.**

## Introduction to Packer

We use the word chapter here, because the training should feel like a story unfolding. The instructor's job is to guide the learners through this interactive story.
